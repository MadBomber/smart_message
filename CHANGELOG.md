## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.15] 2025-09-10

### Added
- **Multi-Transport Publishing**: Messages can now be configured to publish to multiple transports simultaneously
  - **Core Feature**: Configure messages with an array of transports using `transport [transport1, transport2, transport3]` syntax
  - **Resilient Publishing**: Publishing succeeds if ANY configured transport works; only fails if ALL transports fail
  - **Error Handling**: Individual transport failures are logged but don't prevent publishing to remaining transports
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Single transport configuration continues to work unchanged (`transport single_transport`)
  - **Utility Methods**: Added `transports()`, `single_transport?()`, and `multiple_transports?()` for transport introspection
  - **Use Cases**: Supports redundancy, integration, migration, and fan-out messaging patterns

### Enhanced
- **Transport Configuration API**: Extended transport configuration methods to handle both single transports and transport arrays
  - **Plugins Module**: Updated `transport()` method in `lib/smart_message/plugins.rb` to accept arrays while maintaining backward compatibility
  - **Internal Storage**: Transport arrays stored internally but `transport()` getter returns first transport for existing code compatibility
  - **Instance Overrides**: Instance-level transport configuration can override class-level multi-transport settings
- **Publishing Pipeline**: Enhanced message publishing in `lib/smart_message/messaging.rb` for multi-transport support
  - **Parallel Publishing**: Iterates through all configured transports and publishes to each
  - **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs successful and failed transports with detailed error information
  - **Error Aggregation**: Collects all transport errors and raises `PublishError` only when all transports fail
  - **Success Tracking**: Continues processing even when individual transports fail

### Added - Error Handling
- **PublishError**: New error class `SmartMessage::Errors::PublishError` for multi-transport failure scenarios
  - **Condition**: Only raised when ALL configured transports fail to publish
  - **Error Detail**: Aggregates error messages from all failed transports for comprehensive debugging
  - **Added to**: `lib/smart_message/errors.rb`

### Added - Documentation
- **Comprehensive Guide**: Created `docs/transports/multi-transport.md` with complete multi-transport documentation
  - **Real-World Examples**: High-availability, development/production dual publishing, monitoring integration, A/B testing

  - **Configuration Testing**: Class vs instance configuration, transport introspection, method chaining
  - **Mock Transports**: Added `FailingTransport` and `CountingTransport` for controlled testing
  - **Integration Tests**: Real transport combinations (Memory + STDOUT)

### Added - Examples

  - **Error Scenarios**: Partial transport failure resilience and complete failure handling
  - **Utility Demonstrations**: Transport counting, type checking, and configuration inspection

## [0.0.14] 2025-09-10

### Fixed
- **Configuration Architecture**: Fixed `SmartMessage::Serializer.default` method to properly reflect transport-owned serialization architecture
  - **Issue**: `SmartMessage::Serializer.default` was trying to access a non-existent `default_serializer` method on global configuration
  - **Root Cause**: Serialization belongs to transports, not global configuration, but the method was attempting to check global config first
  - **Solution**: Updated method to return framework default (`SmartMessage::Serializer::Json`) directly without depending on global configuration
  - **Architecture Clarification**: Each transport owns and configures its own serializer (line 19 in transport/base.rb: `@serializer = options[:serializer] || default_serializer`)
  - **Demo Fix**: Updated `examples/memory/14_global_configuration_demo.rb` to remove incorrect `config.serializer =` attempts and added architecture comments
- **Test Method Signatures**: Completed wrapper-to-message architecture transition by fixing remaining method signature issues
  - **dispatcher_test.rb**: Changed `processer_one` and `processer_two` from instance methods to class methods (`def self.`)
  - **Message Format**: Updated methods to use flat message structure (`message._sm_header.message_class` and `message.to_json`) instead of old two-tier format (`message_header, encoded_message = message`)
  - **subscribe_test.rb**: Fixed `business_logic` method to be a class method (`def self.business_logic`) to match subscription call pattern
  - **Result**: All tests now pass (`176 runs, 578 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skips`) completing the architectural transition

## [0.0.13] 2025-09-10

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Transport-Level Serialization Architecture**: Major architectural rework moving serializer responsibility from message classes to transport layer
  - **Core Change**: Serializers now associated with transports instead of message classes, enabling different transports to use different serialization formats
  - **Message Structure**: Eliminated wrapper objects in favor of flat message structure with `_sm_header` routing metadata
  - **Serialization Format**: Messages now serialized as single JSON objects containing both header and payload data (e.g., `{"_sm_header": {...}, "content": "value", "property": "data"}`)
  - **Transport Flexibility**: Each transport can now use its own serializer (JSON, MessagePack, etc.) independently
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Added `_sm_payload` and `split` methods to maintain compatibility with existing proc handlers
  - **Performance**: Simplified message processing pipeline with direct message instance passing instead of complex wrapper handling

### Fixed
- **Message Reconstruction**: Fixed critical bug in `SmartMessage::Base#initialize` where payload properties were not properly extracted from flat serialized structure
  - **Root Cause**: Initialization logic looked for `props[:_sm_payload]` but flat structure stores properties directly in `props`
  - **Solution**: Changed to `payload_props = props.except(:_sm_header)` to extract all non-header properties
  - **Impact**: Proc handlers now receive correct message content, resolving nil property values in `_sm_payload`
- **Circuit Breaker Test Compatibility**: Updated circuit breaker tests to use new transport method signatures
  - **Issue**: Tests were calling `transport.publish(header, payload)` with two arguments
  - **Fix**: Updated to `transport.publish(message_instance)` with single message parameter
  - **Result**: All circuit breaker tests now pass with new architecture
- **Deduplication Test Format**: Updated deduplication tests from old wrapper format to new flat structure
  - **Changed**: `_sm_payload: { content: "value" }` â†’ `content: "value"`
  - **Maintained**: Full deduplication functionality with handler-scoped DDQ system

### Enhanced
- **Transport Serialization Control**: Each transport implementation can now specify its preferred serializer
  - **Memory Transport**: Returns message objects directly without serialization for performance
  - **STDOUT Transport**: Uses JSON serializer with pretty printing for human readability
  - **Redis Transport**: Uses MessagePack with JSON fallback for efficient network transmission
- **Message Processing Pipeline**: Streamlined architecture with direct message instance routing
  - **Eliminated**: Complex wrapper object creation and management overhead
  - **Simplified**: Transport `receive` method now directly reconstructs message instances from flat data
  - **Improved**: Cleaner separation between transport concerns and message processing logic

### Added
- **Emergency Services Multi-Program Demo**: Complete emergency dispatch simulation system

  - Updated property descriptions to use constants dynamically (#{VALID_SEVERITY.join(', ')})
  - Enhanced property descriptions to include valid values for better AI prompting
  - Standardized validation message format using constant interpolation across all message types
- **SmartMessage Class-Level Addressing**: Added setter method support for flexible syntax
  - Added from=, to=, reply_to= setter methods to complement existing getter methods

  - Combined filters with OR logic: `subscribe(broadcast: true, to: 'my-service')`
  - String-to-array automatic conversion for convenience: `subscribe(to: 'service')` becomes `['service']`
  - Full backward compatibility - existing subscriptions work unchanged
- **Real-Time Header Synchronization**: Message headers now update automatically when addressing fields change

  - Previous behavior kept original addressing in headers while instance methods showed new values

### Fixed
- **Message Filtering Logic**: Resolved critical filtering implementation issues
  - Fixed message_matches_filters? method to properly evaluate filter criteria
