# Redis Enhanced Transport Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating the advanced features of `SmartMessage::Transport::RedisEnhancedTransport`, which extends the basic Redis transport with RabbitMQ-style pattern matching and intelligent routing capabilities.

## 🚀 What is Redis Enhanced Transport?

The Redis Enhanced Transport is a powerful extension of the basic Redis transport that provides:

- **Pattern-based subscriptions** with wildcard support (`*` and `#`)
- **Fluent API** for building complex subscription patterns
- **Dual channel publishing** for backwards compatibility
- **Enhanced routing** with 3-part channel names: `message_type.from.to`
- **Convenience methods** for common subscription patterns

## 📊 Visual Guide to Key Concepts

### Pattern Matching System

![Enhanced Pattern Matching](../../docs/assets/images/enhanced-pattern-matching.svg)

The enhanced transport uses sophisticated pattern matching to route messages. Unlike basic Redis pub/sub that requires exact channel matches, enhanced transport supports wildcard patterns similar to RabbitMQ:

- **Single Wildcard (`*`)**: Matches exactly one segment
- **Pattern Examples**: `ordermessage.*.*`, `*.payment_gateway.*`, `alertmessage.*.*`
- **Smart Routing**: Messages are matched against all active patterns automatically

### Fluent API Architecture

![Enhanced Fluent API](../../docs/assets/images/enhanced-fluent-api.svg)

The fluent API provides a chainable, readable syntax for building complex subscription patterns:

- **Method Chaining**: `transport.where.from('api').to('service').subscribe`
- **Builder Pattern**: Each method returns a builder for further chaining
- **Pattern Generation**: Automatically converts fluent calls to optimized patterns
- **Type Safety**: Validates patterns at build time

### Dual Publishing Strategy

![Enhanced Dual Publishing](../../docs/assets/images/enhanced-dual-publishing.svg)

Enhanced transport maintains backwards compatibility through dual channel publishing:

- **Backwards Compatible**: Basic Redis subscribers continue to work
- **Gradual Migration**: Upgrade publishers without breaking existing systems  
- **Dual Channels**: Messages published to both original and enhanced formats
- **No Performance Penalty**: Efficient Redis handling of multiple channels

### Microservices Routing

![Enhanced Microservices Routing](../../docs/assets/images/enhanced-microservices-routing.svg)

Perfect for complex microservices architectures requiring intelligent routing:

- **Service-to-Service**: Direct routing between specific services
- **Cross-Service Types**: Subscribe to message types across all services
- **Alert Aggregation**: Centralized monitoring and alerting patterns
- **Dynamic Routing**: Pattern-based routing adapts to service topology changes

## 🔧 Prerequisites

1. **Redis Server**: Make sure Redis is running
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew services start redis
   
   # Linux
   sudo service redis start
   ```

2. **Ruby Dependencies**: Install required gems
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **SmartMessage**: Ensure you're in the SmartMessage project root

## 🌟 Key Concepts

### Enhanced Channel Format

Enhanced channels use a 3-part naming scheme:
```
message_type.from.to
```

Examples:
- `ordermessage.api_gateway.order_service`
- `paymentmessage.payment_service.bank_gateway`
- `alertmessage.monitoring.admin_panel`

### Pattern Wildcards

- `*` - Matches exactly one segment
- `#` - Matches zero or more segments (Redis doesn't support this natively, but Enhanced Transport simulates it)

### Convenience Methods

```ruby
transport.subscribe_to_recipient('payment-service')     # *.*.payment-service
transport.subscribe_from_sender('api-gateway')          # *.api-gateway.*
transport.subscribe_to_type('OrderMessage')             # ordermessage.*.*
transport.subscribe_to_alerts                           # emergency.*.*, *alert*.*.*, etc.
transport.subscribe_to_broadcasts                       # *.*.broadcast
```

### Fluent API Pattern Building

```ruby
# Basic patterns
transport.where.from('service-a').subscribe              # *.service-a.*
transport.where.to('service-b').subscribe                # *.*.service-b
transport.where.type('MessageType').subscribe            # messagetype.*.*

# Combined patterns  
transport.where.from('api').to('db').subscribe           # *.api.db
transport.where.type('Order').from('web').subscribe      # order.web.*
```

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### View Active Patterns

Each example shows how to inspect active pattern subscriptions:

```ruby
pattern_subscriptions = transport.instance_variable_get(:@pattern_subscriptions)
pattern_subscriptions.each { |pattern| puts pattern }
```

### Redis Channel Monitoring

You can monitor Redis channels directly:

```bash
# Monitor all channels
redis-cli monitor

# List active channels
redis-cli pubsub channels "*"

# Monitor specific pattern
redis-cli psubscribe "ordermessage.*"
```

2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Design patterns with clear hierarchies
3. **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
4. **Document Patterns**: Maintain clear documentation of routing patterns

### Migration Strategy

1. **Start with Dual Publishing**: Enable enhanced transport on publishers first
2. **Gradual Subscriber Migration**: Move subscribers one service at a time
3. **Monitor Both Channels**: Ensure no message loss during migration
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance before full deployment
